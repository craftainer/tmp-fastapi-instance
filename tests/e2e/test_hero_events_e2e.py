"""E2E: GET .../events (SSE) for Hero against the live api.

Runs against both `app_mode` legs -- `mock` (InMemoryEventSink) and `dev` (the real
MQTT-backed path, see docs/adrs/0015-mqtt-for-crud-events.md) -- the same way every
other test in this directory is parametrized. tests/integration/crud_1/heroes/
test_heroes_v2_events.py already proves the MQTT persistent-session delivery guarantee
in detail; this file's job is narrower: prove the route actually works end to end
against each mode's live process, closing the coverage this suite would otherwise
leave on `crud.controllers.crud_router`'s `stream_events`/`_sse_events`,
`crud.interfaces.base`'s `MQTTEventSource`/`InMemoryEventSink`, and
`crud.interfaces.dependency`'s event-source provider.

Plain (sync) `httpx`, not Playwright's `page.request`, and not `async def` tests: this
endpoint's response body never completes on its own (see the integration test's own
docstring for why a fully-buffering client deadlocks against it), so it needs a real
incremental read -- `page.request`'s APIResponse only ever exposes the fully-buffered
body. A sync `httpx.Client.stream()` reads incrementally over a real socket without
buffering, and without pulling in pytest-asyncio's event loop, which -- sharing this
session with pytest-playwright's own sync-API event loop -- doesn't tolerate an
`async def` test here (verified: mixing the two here reliably breaks event-loop
teardown for every test in the session, async or not).
