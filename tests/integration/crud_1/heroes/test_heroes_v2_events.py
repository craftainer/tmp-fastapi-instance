"""Integration test: GET /crud/v1/heroes/v2/json/events against the real Mosquitto stack service.

Unlike tests/unit/controllers/test_crud_router.py's MODE=mock InMemoryEventSink coverage
(best-effort, no delivery guarantee -- see InMemoryEventSink's own docstring), this proves
the actual delivery guarantee docs/adrs/0015-mqtt-for-crud-events.md describes: a
subscriber that disconnects, then reconnects with the same subscriber_id, still receives
an event published while it was offline.

This needs a *genuine* concurrently-streaming HTTP connection -- an in-process ASGI
transport (httpx.ASGITransport, or Starlette's own TestClient) fully drains an ASGI app's
response body before returning anything at all (see httpx._transports.asgi.ASGITransport.
handle_async_request's `await self.app(...)` preceding its `return Response(...)`), which
never happens for this route's stream until the client disconnects -- an in-process
transport therefore deadlocks forever against it, with no way to read even the first
frame while the connection is meant to still be open. A real socket does not have this
problem: bytes flow through the OS as they're written, independent of when the whole
request finishes, and closing the connection is what actually delivers an ASGI
`http.disconnect` message to the running app. `_live_server` below runs the real app
under `uvicorn` on a loopback TCP port, as a task on this test's own event loop (not a
separate thread) so the shared async engine/session singleton (see crud.models.base) stays
on the one event loop tests/README.md's "Do" section requires.
